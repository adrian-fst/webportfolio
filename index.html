								Hello! I am Adrian Enciso, this is my personal web porfolio that I
								maintain during my free time. I am a full-time software developer, but
								this is my medium of expressing my creative and front-end development
								skills.
								<br />
								<br />
								I took an IT-centric senior high school track, which led my education
								towards IT-related knowledge, I was primarily exposed to programming and
								software development, but then during my sophomore year while I am
								progressing on my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, I almost
								shifted my preferred career towards multimedia arts, content creation,
								and creative work. Today, I work as a junior software developer for a
								local company that primarily offers enterprise solutions/applications.
								<br />
								<br />
								I am still currently learning, but my passion towards programming,
								software development, and problem-solving has never been this great,
								ever.

								years ago, when we got our first ever personal computer, I was always
								fascinated on how computers operated, and every time we encountered
								issues with it, we always called my mother's colleague who was into
								computers back then. I would say that those memories further cemented my
								passion towards my wanted career now.

								Even though that I am a full-time programmer, I still from time-to-time
								love to create multimedia related contents, I still appreciate other
								creations as well, and I think it really helps to be creative sometimes,
								since programming tends to only stimulate one's analytical skills, I
								still appreciate dealing with multimedia creation.
								<!-- I would say that aside my interest towards computer troubleshooting, I
								personally also enjoy multimedia and anything that has to do with it,
								whether it be creation, consumption, or appreciation, when it comes to
								graphic design, I started learning it back when I was in 8th Grade, I
								was part of a journalism group that competed against other schools
								around our district, I enjoyed experimenting with the tools that we had
								before, and was amazed on what you could do with such tools. Looking
								into the current state of my graphic design interest, I would not say
								that Iâ€™m professional at it, but I am confident enough that I can do a
								great creation when needed. I also enjoy video editing, videography, and
								photography, when given the chance and equipment to do so. -->

							<p>
								I am still continually learning, past programming experience led me to
								know that the learning never stops at school.
								<!-- Even though my course major is related to multimedia arts, a great
								portion of our curriculum contained software development, when I started
								senior high school, I took an Information Communication Technology (ICT)
								track, during the duration of my senior high school I was taught the
								basic fundamentals of programming, we were taught with Java as our first
								language to be in line with the basics of OOP (Object Oriented
								Programming), I was also exposed to early SQL DBMS fundamentals that
								time, and I remember my first major program that I have written all by
								myself, is a simple school enrollment system that releases a simple
								registration form to be printed, I wonâ€™t lie but I forgot how to use
								Java and its swing UI today, but it was a nice educational experience on
								my end. For the 2nd, and last year of my senior high school, my final
								project for that academic year is an RFID-based attendance logging
								system that we never deployed, I remember it using C++, and a borrowed
								reader from our instructor, that project taught me more about database
								management systems and the structured query language, but then again,
								the program logic is not complicated for our young minds back then.
								<br /><br />

								After graduating senior high school, this is when my course majoring
								started to be towards multimedia, during my freshman year in college,
								Iâ€™ve become familiar with the more detailed processes when it comes to
								software development, during this year, we were taught the fundamentals
								of SDLC, more DBMS, which led to RDBMS, though most of which are just
								introductory courses because our major projects that time was more into
								graphic designs and photography.
								<br /><br />

								Going into my sophomore year (2nd Year), our courses became entangled, a
								great portion of the course curriculum is sided towards multimedia, yet
								we had our first â€˜babyâ€™ capstone project that time, leaving me both with
								multimedia projects and development projects. Our final capstone project
								for my 2nd year, is a web-based tire inventory and management system
								written in PHP which I also took the full-stack role for an external
								client, which unfortunately, we havenâ€™t deployed due to the initial
								spike of nCoV (now Covid-19) on our country which caused the initial
								lockdowns, we have submitted it for them to use, but there was no proper
								turnover whatsoever.
								<br /><br />
								For my final senior year (3rd Year), we were reintroduced to software
								engineering fundaments, as well as information assurance and security,
								our final capstone project which not surprisingly, I become as the team
								full stack programmer(again), is a complete web-based clinic appointment
								handling and clinic management for a small-scale clinic (JS, PHP), it is
								still undergoing tests, but is both approved by our thesis adviser,
								course facilitator, and the clinic owner. -->

						During my free time, I tend to enjoy just thinking silently, other than
						that, I also have other hobbies, I tend to like to tinker with things when
						something is broken, I learned soldering at a young age, and I honestly
						think that it allowed me to further try out more things other than just
						sitting in front of a computer, I also play the ukulele, Iâ€™d admit that
						Iâ€™m not that good with it, but I found it relaxing and enjoyable when I
						play it.
						<br /><br />
						I play video games from time to time during my spare time, Iâ€™m also
						interested on the mechanical keyboards hobby I currently have 2 customized
						mechanical keyboards in my collection, but I think Iâ€™d have more the more
						I get into the hobby, I also spend a lot of time improving my typing WPM
						(words per minute) and consistency because I think it is a great asset to
						possess when dealing with software development, but most of the time I
						just think about a lot of things and sit quietly.
